## Description
This is a simple database program designed to use in the Automotive Shop.
It's supposed to provide a way to create invoices and quotes for the clients and a way to easily look up the vehicle's service history - without any cloud, servers, and subscription fees.
It works offline. Best suited to a very small business.

## Download
[https://github.com/peterPacho/AutoInvoicer/releases/tag/release](https://github.com/peterPacho/AutoInvoicer/releases/tag/release)

Download the AutoInvoicer_X.X.X.zip file, extract anywhere, run AutoInvoicer.exe. Program will create "Invoices.db" file - that is the whole database.
There is an option to make a backup of the database (once a day) - it's recommended to point the program to some cloud storage like Google Drive so database will survive if computer is lost or broken.

## License
Do whatevery you want. Free for business use. 
No warranty of any sort. It was somewhat tested - the two-person shop that I wrote it for (me being one of the mechanics) accumulated almost 2,000 invoices before I left that place.


There is no public version history before 1.4.0. Whole repository was reuploaded to remove any personal info.

## Features
Program offers simple invoice editor, field for notes that can be seen only be the shop, and a way to generate invoice for the client. Cost field support math operations, and service text field have build-in service shortcuts for common services like brake replacement or oil changes.
